  definition: Columbia-Suicidality Severity Rating Scale Baseline (C-SSRS Baseline)
    What sort of reasons did you have for thinking about wanting to die or killing
    yourself? Was it to end the pain or stop the way you were feeling (in other words
    you couldn't go on living with this pain or how you were feeling) or was it to
    get attention, revenge or a reaction from others? Or both?
