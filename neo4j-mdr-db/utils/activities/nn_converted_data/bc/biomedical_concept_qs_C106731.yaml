  definition: Columbia-Suicidality Severity Rating Scale Baseline/Screening Version
    (C-SSRS Baseline/Screening Version) What sort of reasons did you have for thinking
    about wanting to die or killing yourself? Was it to end the pain or stop the way
    you were feeling (in other words you couldn't go on living with this pain or how
    you were feeling) or was it to get attention, revenge or a reaction from others?
    Or both? (Lifetime).
