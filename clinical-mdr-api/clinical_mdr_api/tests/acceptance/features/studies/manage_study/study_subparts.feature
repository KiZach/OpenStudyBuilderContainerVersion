Feature: Maintaining Study Subparts for a Study Parent Part in Clinical MDR API

    Background: Test user must be able to call the Clinical MDR API and test data exist
        Given The test user can call the Clinical MDR API
        Given a test Study identified by 'uid' is in status 'Draft'

    Rule: As an API user,
        I want the system to support Definition of Study Subparts for a Study Parent Part,
        So that I can support Studies holding multiple parts with individual Study Definitions and Study Designs.

            And consecutive Study Subparts are assigned a consecutive new derived Study Subpart ID
            And all derived Study Subpart ID are unique within the set of subparts for the Study Parent Part


        Scenario: Changing the Study fields or selections except the Study Title and Registry Identifiers of a Study Subpart is allowed

            And remaining Study Subparts are assigned a consecutive new derived Study Subpart ID
            And the value for derived Study Subpart ID, Subpart acronym and description is cleared

        Scenario: When the last Study Subpart is removed from a Study Parent Part then the Study Parent Part change to be a normal Study
