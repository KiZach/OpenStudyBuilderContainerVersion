Feature: Maintaining Study Operational SOA in Clinical MDR API

    Background: Test user must be able to call the Clinical MDR API and test data exist
        Given The test user can call the Clinical MDR API
        Given a test study identified by 'uid' is available holding test data


    Rule: As an API user,
        I want the system to support display of the Operational SoA,
        So that I can use this view for overview of the study data specification.

        Scenario: Support display of Operational SoA
        # Gherkin to be made


    Rule: As an API user,
        I want the system to support download of Operational SoA in .csv and Excel file formats,
        So that I can use the files for reviews and downstream integrations.

        Scenario Outline: Download of collections by visits of study activity instances in Excel file format
            When The GET API endpoint '/studies/<uid>/operational-soa-exports' is called with Accept header 'application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet' to download Operational SoA in Excel file format
            Then The API must return the following columns with one row for each collection of an study activity instance by a visit
                | column | header            |
                | 1      | Study number      |
                | 2      | Study version     |
                | 3      | SoA group         |
                | 4      | Activity group    |

                | 10     | Topic code        |
                | 11     | Param code        |

        Scenario Outline: Download of collections by visits of study activity instances in .csv file format
            When The GET API endpoint '/studies/<uid>/operational-soa-exports' is called with Accept header 'text/csv' to download Operational SoA in .csv file format
            Then The API must return the following columns with one row for each collection of an study activity instance by a visit
                | column | header            |
                | 1      | study_number      |

    Rule: As an API user,
        I want the system to support download of Operational SoA in DOCX file format,
        So that I can use the matrix representation in DOCX to review the Operational SoA.
