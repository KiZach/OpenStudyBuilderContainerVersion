Feature: Maintaining Study Activity Instances in Clinical MDR API

    Background: Test user must be able to call the Clinical MDR API and test data exist
        Given The test user can call the Clinical MDR API

    Rule: As an API user,
        I want the system to ensure only valid activity instances can be added to a study,
        So that I get consistency between the Detailed SoA and the Operational SoA.

        Scenario Outline: Only activity instances linked to a study activity within a valid grouping can be added to the study
            When a study activity instance is added to a study using the POST or PATCH API endpoint '/studies/<uid>/study-activity-instances'
            Then the API must ensure only an activity instance can be added if it is related to a valid activity grouping for an existing study activity
       
        Examples:
            |TestFile                                                                 | TestID                                            |
            |/tests/integration/api/study_selections/test_study_activity_instances.py | @TestID:test_create_study_activity_instance       |

    Rule: As an API user,
        I want the system to classify the current state and needed actions for study activity instances,
        So that I get consistent and complete definition of the Operational SoA versus the Detailed SoA and activity definitions in the library.

        Scenario Outline: State/Actions for Study Activity Instances must be classified by the API as combination of activity selections, Boolean attributes, version and status of Activity Instances in the library
            When The API GET endpoint '/studies/<uid>/study-activity-instances' is called
            Then the response of Study Activity Instances must include classification of <State/Actions> information, <Colour highlight>, <Indicator icon> based on <Rule>
            Examples:
                | Indicator icon       | State/Action                                         | Colour highlight | Rule                                                                                                                         |
                |                      | Required                                             | Green            | Activity Instance is required_for_activity and currently selected for the Activity                                           |

                |                      | Add optional selection if relevant                   | Green            | Additional optional Activity Instances can be made as this Activity support multiple selections                              |

    Rule: As an API user,
        I want the system to support download of study activity instances in .csv and Excel file formats,
        So that I can use the files for reviews and downstream integrations.

        Scenario Outline: Download of study activity instances in .csv and Excel file formats
            When the GET API endpoint '/studies/<uid>/study-activity-instances' is called to download study activity instances in <file-format>
            Then the API must return the following columns with one row for each study activity instances
                # Note in .csv file column header is without underscores in lower case, in Excel as specified.
                | column | header              |

    Rule: As an API user,
          I want the system to add required and defaulted study activity instances when a study activity is added,
          So that I get a simplified workflow when defining the Detailed and Operational SoA.

       Scenario Outline: Add required and defaulted study activity instances when a study activity is added
            When an activity is added to a study within a specific activity grouping
            Then the related activity instances marked as required or defaulted in the library within the specific grouping must be added to the study activity instances
       
        Examples:
            |TestFile                                                                 | TestID                                                                                       |

      Scenario Outline:
            When only one activity instance is related to a study activity within the grouping then this activity instance must be added to the study as a default
            And an activity is added to a study within a specific activity grouping
            And this study activity only is related to one activity instance within this activity grouping
            Then the related activity instances within the specific grouping must be added to the study activity instances
       
        Examples:
            |TestFile                                                                 | TestID                                            |
            |/tests/integration/api/study_selections/test_study_activity_instances.py | @TestID:test_study_activity_instances_states      |

    Rule: As an API user,
          I want the system to remove study activity instances when the related study activity is removed,
          So that I get consistency in the Detailed and Operational SoA.

        Scenario Outline: Remove study activity instances when a study activity is removed
            When an study activity is removed from a study within a specific activity grouping
            Then the related study activity instances must also be removed within the same specific grouping

        Examples:
            |TestFile                                                                 | TestID                                                                                       |
