Feature: Manage Registry Identifiers in Clinical MDR API

    Background: Test user must be able to call the Clinical MDR API and test data exist
        Given The test user can call the Clinical MDR API
        Given a test study identified by 'uid' is in status 'Locked' for the 'study_value_version'

    Rule: As an API user,
        I want the system to ensure registry identifiers can be defined for  a study,
        So these can be used as part of the study specification in down-stream systems.


        Scenario Outline: The API must support creation of registry identifiers for a study
            When the <registry identifier> registry identifier is created for a study using the POST API endpoint '/studies'
            Then the <registry identifier> is defined for the study
            Examples:
                | registry identifier                                    |
                | ClinicalTrials.gov ID                                  |

        Scenario Outline: The API must support update of registry identifiers for a study
            When the <registry identifier> registry identifier is updated for a study using the PATCH API endpoint '/studies'
            Then the <registry identifier> is updated for the study
            Examples:
                | registry identifier                                    |
