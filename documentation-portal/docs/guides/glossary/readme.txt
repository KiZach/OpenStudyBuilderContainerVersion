This folder holds the StudyBuilder glossary.

Use the glossary.xlsx file to maintain the glossary definition, and make sure to sort the content in alphabetical order.
Note the content is made in '.md' markdown format, and simply copy the content into the glossary.md file.
This is to manage the copy paste from other sources and sorting in a simple way.
